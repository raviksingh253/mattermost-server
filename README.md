- Adding redis settings. 
  ```json 
   "RedisSettings": {
        "Enable": true,
        "EnableRedisCluster": true,
        "Address": "localhost:6379",
        "PoolSize": 100, 
        "Index": 2
    } 
    ```
2. Build mattermost-webapp for redis clustering (This version added Redis settings under advanced tab/ console admin)
- Checkout mattermost-webapp for redis clustering version here:https://github.com/mrbkiter/mattermost-webapp.git
- Place the project under same parent folder of mattermost-server (for example, you placed mattermost-server under src/ folder, now you should place mattermost-webapp under same one)
- Run ``make build`` to build webapp project. You need to install node. 

3. Run mattermost-server (this step require you have basic knowledge of Golang and how to setup Golang environment)
- Go to mattermost-server
- Run ``go run cmd/mattermost/main.go`` if you like to use go command.
- Or run ``make run-server`` to use make cmd. Please note that this command would automatically install docker dependent images such as DB, .... 
- Or run ``make run-server-no-docker`` if you like to run without docker dependencies. For this case, you would need to create an empty database, and update JDBC URL in config/config.json

- Go to mattermost-server
- Run ``go build -o mattermost cmd/mattermost/main.go``, or for linux-built environment, run ``GOOS=linux go build -o mattermost cmd/mattermost/main.go``, or for Windows run ``GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mattermost cmd/mattermost/main.go``
